##ReadMe
This GitHub repository contains several files, all pertaining to the Reproducible Research Peer Assessment assigned by Dr. Roger Peng via Coursera. The names of the files/folders are similar, so it can be a little tricky figuring out what's what. Basically, the file extensions are the key. PA1_template.Rmd, PA1_template.md, and PA1_template.html are all different versions of the same document. 

The ".Rmd" file is probably the most basic; it's used to generate the ".md" file and the ".md" file is used to generate the ".html" file. Within this repo, the most polished file is probably the **".md"** file. This is because the ".html" file is seen as source code on GitHub's website. The figures contained in the ".md" file are included in the PA1_template_files/figure-html directory listed within the repo. Lastly, the dataset "activity.zip" has also been included in the repository for reproducibility.

I know that there is potential for error in every portion of this repo, including this ReadMe, but I hope it is helpful to you.  In either case, have a nice day.
